MATLAB code on project: Role of Energy Positive Buildings in Future Low-Carbon Energy Systems. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Utilised ICLOCS 2.5 on MATLAB interface for problem formulation and IPOPT as solver.
- Linear programming (LP) to optimize residential consumers' energy cost and mitigate carbon footprints
- Basic residential building model with Model Predictive Control (MPC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Components: Heat Pump (HP), LiFePO4 Battery, Solar PV, Electricity Grid, Residential Model
- Exogenous variables: External Temperature, Electricity Tariff, DR Availability, DR Call Signal, Probabilistic Incentives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Study of Demand Response (DR) approach 
- Interplay of lottery incentive system, constant incentives, and time-varying prices
- Call signals were sent to the residential building to request DR contribution to grid
- One-week simulations for winter and summer seasons
- Results: Up to 31.11% in energy bill savings and reduction of up to 12.72% in carbon emissions during winter.
           Revenue of up to 4.57 Â£/week and potential carbon mitigation of up to 10.28% during summer. 
- Further Work: Calibration of incentive rewards for DR applications in residential households.
